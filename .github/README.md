## About 🚀
This repository contains my dotfiles for my Arch Linux system (i3 and hyprland), which I use as a Computer Science undergraduate. This repository serves both as a backup for my configuration files and as a guide for others who wish to replicate my setup.

## Getting Started 🌱
If you're new to riceing, you can start from the [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md) section. This document outlines the necessary tools, packages, and assumptions required for a smooth installation and setup process.

If you're already familiar with the prerequisites, you can jump straight to the [Installation](docs/installation.md) section. This section details the installation of the window manager, critical software, and other essential tools.

Once you've completed the installation, you can proceed to the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) section. This section covers the configuration of the window manager, terminal emulator, and other essential tools.

Finally, the [Customization](docs/customization.md) section provides additional tips and tricks for customizing your system further. This section includes information on theming, fonts, and other aesthetic enhancements.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a clean and functional setup like the ones shown above. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me via email or GitHub.

## Compatibility ⚙️
While this guide is created with Arch Linux in mind, it can also be helpful for users of other distributions who are familiar with their package management and system tweaking.

## Documentation 📚
The Installation is divided into the following sections:
1. [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md)
2. [Installation](docs/installation.md)
3. [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)
4. [Customization](docs/customization.md)
5. [Summary](docs/summary.md)
